# Image-Captioning
Image Captioning ia a process that combines computer vision and natural language processing techniques together to understand the content of an image and generate a coherent and relevant
description. It generate textual descriptions for images automatically. This Project applies ResNet50 Convolutional Neural Network architecture and Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) to image captioning for Flickr8k dataset.
